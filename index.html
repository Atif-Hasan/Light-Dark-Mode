        Closures are confusing because they are an “invisible” concept.
    </p>

   <p> When you use an object, a variable, or a function, you do this intentionally. You think: “I’m gonna need a variable here,” and add it to your code.</p>
   <p>
    Closures are different. By the time most people approach closures, they have already used them unknowingly many times — and it is likely that this is true for yourself, too. So learning closures is less about understanding a new concept and more about recognizing something you have already been doing for a while.
</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong></p>
<p>
    You have a closure when <span>a function accesses variables defined outside of it.</span>
</p>
<p>
For example, this code snippet contains a closure:
</p>

<p class="closure-example">
    <code>
        let users = ['Alice', 'Dan', 'Jessica'];<br>
        let query = 'A';<br>
        let user = users.filter(user => user.startsWith(query));
    </code>
</p>

<p>
    Notice how user =&gt; user.startsWith(query) is itself a function. It uses the query variable. But the query variable is defined outside of that function. That’s a closure.
</p>

    <span>You can stop reading here, if you want.</span> The rest of this article approaches closures in a different way. Instead of explaining what a closure is, it will walk you through the process of discovering closures — like the first programmers did in the 1960s.
